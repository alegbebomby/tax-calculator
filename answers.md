1. As stated there may be bugs in the code, try to find and fix them.
    1. The toll free vehicle enum is incorrect  I had to add Busess removed tractor
    2. Improve isTollFreeVehicle to be configurable not hard coded 
    3. In get tollFee change the condition to align with time interval
    4. Public holiday is specific to each year so that should be parsed as config
    5. Improve the getTax function to consider total fee for a particular day not exceeding 60 
    
There is no particular structure to the code so there are several improvements that can be made.
1. test all configurations 
2. add more validation to the configuration loaded
3. write more unit test
4. better ways more vehicle 
5. Make the rules more fexible
